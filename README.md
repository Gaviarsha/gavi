this project working about matrix calculator. it can do a addition,subtraction,multiplication,determinant, and inverse(2x2). other than inverse, the program can also continue to add the matrix in the matrix addition
for addition and subtraction function it can add or subtract from previous result 
also for inverse function can make a determinant from the result of inverse function
