this project working about matrix calculator. it can do a addition,subtraction,multiplication,determinant, and inverse(2x2). other than inverse, the program can also continue to add the matrix in the matrix addition
for addition and subtraction function it can add or subtract from previous result 
also for inverse function can make a determinant from the result of inverse function

so in the first image, it explain how the program works. In the first menu, you can choose to select the formula.
and the second image is you can add another matrix to the formula to after the first formula.
